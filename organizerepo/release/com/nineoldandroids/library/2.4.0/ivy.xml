      Android library for using the Honeycomb (Android 3.0) animation API on all versions 
      of the platform back to 1.0!

      Animation prior to Honeycomb was very limited in what it could accomplish so in 
      Android 3.x a new API was written. With only a change in imports, we are able to 
      use a large subset of the new-style animation with exactly the same API.

      This library also includes support for animating rotation, translation, alpha, 
      and scale on platforms prior to Honeycomb!
